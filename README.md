Logistic regression model for exploring the relation between HDI and tap water availability in countries

Intent in this work was to model tap water prevalence in different countries compared to their Human Development Index level to compare if there would happen to exist a given HDI level that could be visioned to enable tap water access to a country. At the same time this allows the writer the opportunity to exercise his ability of statistical inference with multiple tools, in this work mainly LibreOffice, Java 8 and Apache Commons Math 3.6.1.
Results
The resulting models show that in year 2015 the HDI level associated with wider tap water prevalence is higher than in year 1990, which is somewhat surprising.

The results suggest that while HDI levels of countries of the world have improved clearly from 1990 to 2015, the availability of piped tap water has not increased in the pace as one could have expected if tap water was clearly linked to the HDI level of the countries.
